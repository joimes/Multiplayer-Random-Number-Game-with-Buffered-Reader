# Multiplayer-Random-Number-Game-with-Buffered-Reader
One of my final projects from my introductory Java course. Blood, sweat, and tears.
// Summary: Design the infamous Random Number Game w/ specific conditions
// but make it multiplayer for any amount of users.
// and also create a log file for each player + the game itself (per round)
